# Brain-Tumor-Distribution-Analysis


## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Brain Tumor Distribution Analysis Dashboard** designed to analyze patient records and tumor characteristics across different grades, age groups, brain regions, and diagnosis status. The dashboard provides clear insights into tumor prevalence, trends over time, and demographic impact to support data-driven healthcare decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze brain tumor distribution by grade and type
- Identify the most affected age groups and brain regions
- Track annual trends in diagnosed patients
- Compare confirmed and unconfirmed tumor cases
- Present insights using an intuitive and interactive dashboard

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** for data modeling and visualization
- **Excel / CSV** for data preparation
- **GitHub** for version control and portfolio hosting

---

## 📊 Key Metrics Displayed
- Total number of patients
- Average patient age
- Average tumor size
- Most affected age group
- Most affected brain region
- Annual patient diagnosis trend

---

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- Interactive filters for **Confirmed** and **Unconfirmed** cases
- Tumor grade segmentation (Grade 1 to Grade 4)
- Tumor type distribution using donut charts
- Brain region impact ranking
- Age group distribution analysis
- Time-series analysis of annual diagnoses

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Certain age groups show significantly higher tumor prevalence
- Tumor occurrence varies strongly by brain region and tumor grade
- Annual diagnosis trends reveal fluctuations that may indicate changes in detection or reporting
- Higher tumor grades are associated with larger average tumor sizes

---

## 🧠 Use Case
